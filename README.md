### Required to run correctly:
- Make sure files in the 'scene' directory are either 'initScene', 'returnScene' or 'Scene{x}' where {x} is an integer

- Do not edit the paths directory. The files inside of it are generated by running 'createPaths.py' in the src directory

- Make sure there are an equal number of points in all of the files in the scene directory :)

# There is also a 'generateCords.py' file in ./cords/utils/ should you need it. If you need to edit the amount of drones it makes, there is a variable at the top of the file to edit.
